Consists of three files:

A paper, on how to generate instances of the travelling salesman such that the optimal and nearly-optimal solutions are known.

A Fortran source (f90) using the results of the above mentioned paper to generate instances of the travelling salesman problem and investigate
the performance of greedy algorithms to solve them.

A python file to handle presentation of the results. Also compiles and executes the Fortran code for the experiment, for convenience.


I cannot emphasise enough how young and inexperienced I was when I wrote these (though I've checked and they do all run): USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!
